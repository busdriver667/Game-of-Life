# Game-of-Life
Game of Life created in Java for a coding challenge.
To play the game, please click the cells you would like to bring to life and then press start. 
Some positions are buggy for now (more info in Issues).

I have assumed that the Game of Life cannot be infinite in practice, and so I have given the user the option of choosing how large the cells are. Currently you are able to observe a grid of up to 50 x 50 cells, or as little as 2 x 2.
